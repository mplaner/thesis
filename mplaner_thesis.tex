\begin{abstract}
The results of the measurement of the Higgs boson decaying into two photons with the 2015 and 2016 dataset is described.  The analysis is performed using the dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi . Event classification was performed to maximize signal efficiency and to study gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, vector boson associated production, and  top fusion Higgs Boson production modes.  Expected sensitivity to the Higgs boson, based on the data-driven estimation of the background is presented.  The analysis shows a median expected significance of \expsig~ for the SM Higgs boson at \bestmass. The observed significance at \mh = \bestmass~ is presented.  A measurement of the mass using the 2016 dataset and the fiducial cross section of the Higgs boson decaying to two photons is also presented.

\begin{acknowledge}
  I would like to acknowledge my two advisors, Prof. Colin Jessop and
  Research Associate Prof. Nancy Marinelli.  Federico Ferri, Seth
  Zenz, Martina Malberti, Shervin Nourbakhsh (Hgg conveners).  The
  entire Hgg team.  My many office mates in 512: Matthias Wolf, Dr
  Geoff Smith, Fanbo Meng, Dr Yutaro Iiyama who provided both
  technical support and an atmosphere of fun.  My lunchtime group,
  which changed considerably over my time at CERN: Prof. Ted Kolberg,
  Prof. Rachel Yohay, Dr David Morse, Dr Bingxuan Liu, Dr Paul Lujan,
  Juliana Froggatt, Dr Kelly Beernaert, Dr Jess Brinson, and Justin
  Pilot.  My friends at Notre Dame were important to me as well, but
  of particular import is Christopher Wotta.  A more trustworthy
  friend is hard to come by and knowing that I always had a place to
  sleep in South Bend was of no small comfort.  During my time at
  CERN, I was blessed with profound friendships which helped me
  progress both in physics and life.  Dr Sarah Boutle was for a time,
  my only officemate and helped make the first year at CERN a
  delightful experience.  Dr Vera Chetvertkova was a wonderful
  companion on the bus and through many adventures in the Franco-Swiss
  region.  Dr Juliette Alimena's frienship and patience meant a lot to
  me during the final year that I spent at CERN.  Dr Charlie Mueller
  was a brilliant friend throughout graduate school both at Notre Dame
  and at CERN.  And finally, I thank my parents, Norm and Sharon, for
  all their support over the years.  They provided me with every
  opportunity to succeed, while giving me the space to create and
  solve many of my own challenges.  Through their love and guidance
  I've grown from a small child who kept falling out of trees while
  wondering how the world works to an adult who quantifies the
  workings of the world (and who only falls out of trees when he
  intends to).
